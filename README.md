# Inventory and Sales Management System
A simple C++ console application for managing stock inventory and recording sales transactions. Built using **Code::Blocks IDE**, employees can add products, update stock, process sales, and generate daily sales reports.

##  Project Context

This application was developed for a medium-sized retail company seeking a lightweight, console-based solution to track inventory and record daily sales. The focus is on simplicity, efficiency, and file-based data persistence without external libraries or databases.
